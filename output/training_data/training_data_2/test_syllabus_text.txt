Subject: SEC -2: Green Chemistry  
Credit: 04 (T) + 02(P)  Total learning hours: 60 
Course description: This course provides an overview of fundamental topics in green chemistry. 
Green Chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use 
and generation of hazardous substances. While there are many mechanisms and tools available 
to assess  the impact of materials and processes on human health and the environment, there are few 
tools available to help  design and create  products  as such.  
This course will present the fundamentals of the 12 principles of green chemistry, and explore 
relevant examples of their practical use in commercial applications.  
 This course will explore examples from a wide spectrum of industrial sectors including 
construction, personal care, pharmaceuticals and electronics.  
 Through examples, students will be presented with the premise that green chemistry offers 
organizations a boost to innovation and faster time to market.  
Student learning outcome: Upon completion of this course,  
Students learn  the basic principles of  green  and sustainable chemistry  
They must be able to do and understand stoichiometric calculations and relate them 
to green  process metrics.  
They learn alternative solvent media and energy sources for  chemical  processes.
