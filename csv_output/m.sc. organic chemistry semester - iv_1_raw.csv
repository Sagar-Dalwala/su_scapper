Course description:\rThis course will give an introduction to dyes and pigments. The primary goal of this course is to\rmake students aware of how dyes can be classified and the basic chemistry applied in dyeing\rprocess. This subject provides fundamental knowledge of various types of dyes and how to carry\rout dyeing process in textile industries. This course also includes applications of dyes in the field\rother than textile fibres.                      NaN
