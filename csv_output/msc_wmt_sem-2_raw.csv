  Purpose of Course This course is make relevant & up to-date in the digital world with the
                     deep understanding of UX. Learn to create persuasive user experience &
               get an edge over the others. It is design-centric approach to user interface
                  and user experience design, and offers practical, skill-based instruction
                                       centered around a visual communications perspective.
       Course Objective UI design is about the look and feel of the website or application.
                           UX design improves the overall experience of the users when they
                                                  interact with the website or application.
              Prerequisite Basic Knowledge of software designing & prototyping is required.
       Course Out come On successful completion of this subject, a student will be able to:
                      Describe aspects of user interaction and cognition as they relate to
                                                                                     UI/UX.
                           Explain the role and importance of Standards, Technologies, and
                                               Guidelines in the UX process and UI process.
                               Select and apply appropriate methods for analysing a design
                    Select and apply the relevant descriptive statistical tests associated
                                                                                  with UX .
                           Analyse problems associated with different designs and suggests
                                                            solutions for their resolution.
Course Description: The UI/UX Design brings a design-centric approach to user interface and
                      user experience design, and offers practical, skill-based instruction
                    centered around a visual communications perspective, rather than on one
                    focused on marketing or programming alone. In this sequence of courses,
                        summarize and demonstrate different stages of the UI/UX development
                   process, from user research to defining a project’s strategy, scope, and
                  information architecture, to developing sitemaps and wireframes. Students
                 will learn conventions in UX design and apply them to create effective and
                                  compelling screen-based experiences for websites or apps."
