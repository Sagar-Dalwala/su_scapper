Student learning outcome:\r●Students will develop an understanding on basic idea of gene cloning, its importance, types\rof enzymes used as tools in gene cloning as being prime players.\r●As being carriers of genes of interest, students will understand about different types of\rvectors and comparative advantages offered by each of them so that proper choice of\rvector can be done.\r●Students will gain knowledge about techniques to insert prepared clones into different\rorganisms and identification of recombinants.\r●The unit focuses on and thus provides knowledge of different techniques to, first, identify\rand then further validation of recombinants.\r●At the end of the course, the students will have sufficient scientific understanding of the\rsubject and have good knowledge of application of Recombinant DNA techniques in Life\rSciences Research.
