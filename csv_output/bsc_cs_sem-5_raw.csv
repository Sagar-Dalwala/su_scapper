              NaN           forefront of computer science research, including areas like machine
              NaN          learning, planning, computer vision, natural language processing, and
              NaN many others. It is the goal of this course to study Artificial Intelligence in
              NaN     today's environment and to instill an understanding of representations and
              NaN  external constraints with the idea of enabling a student to think creatively.
              NaN                       The subject also extends concepts of Internet of Things.
 Course Objective                                                 The objectives are as follows:
              NaN         1) To give initial exposure of Artificial Intelligence to the students
