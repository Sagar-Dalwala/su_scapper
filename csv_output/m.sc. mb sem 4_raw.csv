  The aim of the dissertation is to develop inclination towards research.The dissertation presents
      a major piece of guided independent research on a topic agreed between the student and their
supervisor. It typically involves a literature review and an appropriate form of critical analysis
    of sources of primary and /or secondary data; it may involve field and/or laboratory work. The
    dissertation must show evidence of wide reading and understanding, of critical analysis and/or
                                                  appropriate use of advanced research techniques.

    The study aims to reveal how the students improved their academic presentation skills and to
       improvement with influences of students’ scientific and language backgrounds. This course
       engages students in critical inquiry through reading, discussion, oral presentations, and
    writing, emphasizing an in-depth exploration of the writing process from generating ideas to
                                                                      polishing the final draft.
As academic presentation skills are crucial to research and are a generic skill that PG students
        in science must acquire, we propose that existing student seminar programmes can be used
                             effectively as an active training programme to improve such skills.

                     Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:
                  Students will demonstrate the ability to perform close and critical readings.
        Students will develop ability to comprehends the relevant topic and effectively explain

            presentations, noting main points or evidence and tracking threads through different
                                                                                       comments.
         Students will be able to challenge and offer substantive replies to others' arguments,
