Sc (Clinical) Embryology Course\rThe Master of Science (M.Sc.) in (Clinical) Embryology is a specialized postgraduate program\rdesigned for individuals aiming to pursue a career in reproductive medicine and assisted\rreproductivetechnologies(ART).Thiscomprehensivecourseprovidesanin-depth\runderstanding of embryology, the branch of biology that studies the development of gametes,\rfertilization, and the development of embryos and fetuses. It combines theoretical knowledge\rwith practical training, covering subjects such as reproductive physiology, molecular genetics,\rand advanced laboratory techniques. Graduates of this program are equipped with the expertise\rto work in fertility clinics, research institutions, and academic settings, contributing to the\radvancement of reproductive health and the treatment of infertility.\rThe syllabus of the M.Sc. (Clinical) Embryology program is meticulously designed to provide a\rrobust foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of embryology and reproductive\rsciences. The curriculum encompasses a wide array of subjects, including reproductive anatomy\rand physiology, molecular biology, genetics, and endocrinology, all of which are essential for\runderstanding human reproduction and development. Practical modules offer hands-on training\rin advancedlaboratorytechniques such asin vitrofertilization (IVF), embryo culture,\rcryopreservation, and micromanipulation. Additionally, the program covers ethical, legal, and\rpsychosocial aspects of reproductive medicine, ensuring that students are well-prepared to\rnavigate the complexities of clinical practice. Through a blend of lectures, laboratory sessions,\rand research projects, students gain the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the field of\rclinical embryology and contribute to innovations in assisted reproductive technologies (ART).\rYou willgain hands-on- training & practical knowledge during the entire course and will be\renriched by subject knowledge which will make you outstanding in your professional life later.\rProgram Duration and Eligibility:\rDuration4 Semesters (2 Years)\rIntake15 Seats            Unnamed: 0
