Course Description: The UI/UX Design brings a design-centric approach to user interface and user
              experience design, and offers practical, skill-based instruction centered around a
                   visual communications perspective, rather than on one focused on marketing or
                       programming alone. In this sequence of courses, summarize and demonstrate
                        different stages of the UI/UX development process, from user research to
               defining a project’s strategy, scope, and information architecture, to developing
                 sitemaps and wireframes. Students will learn conventions in UX design and apply
                them to create effective and compelling screen-based experiences for websites or
                                                                                           apps.
