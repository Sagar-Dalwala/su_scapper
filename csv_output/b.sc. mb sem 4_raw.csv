             Course description: Nanoscience is the study of structures and molecules on the scale of
  nanometers and the technology which utilizes it in practical applications is called nanotechnology.
          Today, engineers and researchers are finding a wide variety of methods to deliberately make
     nanoscale materials to take the advantages of their enhanced properties such as higher strength,
       lighter weight, high chemical reactivity, etc. also the nanotechnology offers more advances in
  disease treatments, in imaging and diagnostics equipment, in energy efficient products such as fuel
and solar cells, etc. so in order to move towards the advanced materials and devices, students should
                                                                   have the knowledge of nanoscience.
                        Student learning outcome: After learning the course,students should be able :
                                  To understand the difference between bulk and nanoscale materials.
                                                      To understand the basics of nanoscale science.
        To understand the synthesizing technique and difficulties to synthesize the nanomaterials so
                  they can get interest in the search of new composition techniques of nanomaterials.
                           To understand the various applications of nanoscience and nanotechnology."
