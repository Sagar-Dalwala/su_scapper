Course description: The control of microbial growth is necessary in many practical situations,\rthus significant advances in agriculture, medicine, and food science have been made through\rstudy of this area of microbiology. Control of microorganisms is essential so as to prevent the\rtransmission of diseases & infection, stop decomposition and spoilage, and prevent unwanted\rmicrobial contamination. Therefore, controlling microbial growth is important in medical field,\rpharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, academic research, and food industry. Ever since\rmicrobes were shown to cause diseases, different techniques have been invented to control their\rspread.                      NaN
