      Course description: This course paper intends to deal about the Forensic Toxicology, the branch
     of science that applies the principles and knowledge of toxicology to issues and problems in the
    field of law. To achieve this, techniques of analytical chemistry are combined with principles of
toxicology to address issues related to the toxic effects of substances on humans that are germane to
     judicial proceedings. Analytical chemistry deals with the techniques and methods for determining
                       the identity and relative amounts of unknown components in a sample of matter.
