Course description:  This course paper intends to deal about the Forensic Toxicology, the branch\rof science that applies the principles and knowledge of toxicology to issues and problems in the\rfield of law. To achieve this, techniques of analytical chemistry are combined with principles of\rtoxicology to address issues related to the toxic effects of substances on humans that are germane to\rjudicial proceedings. Analytical chemistry deals with the techniques and methods for determining\rthe identity and relative amounts of unknown components in a sample of matter.                      NaN
