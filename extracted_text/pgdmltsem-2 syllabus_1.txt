Course description: This course paper intends to deal about the Forensic  Toxicology, the branch of 
science that applies the principles and knowledge of toxicology to issues and problems in the field 
of law. To achieve this, techniques of analytical chemistry are combined with principles of 
toxicology to address issues related to the toxic effects of substances on humans that are germane to 
judicial procee dings. Analytical chemistry deals with the techniques and methods for determining 
the identity and relative amounts of unknown components in a sample of matter.   
Student learning outcome:  
 At the end of the course students will be able to learn...
