Course description: This course provides an overview of fundamental topics in green chemistry. 
Green Chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use 
and generation of hazardous substances. While there are many mechanisms and tools available 
to assess  the impact of materials and processes on human health and the environment, there are few 
tools available to help  design and create  products  as such.

Program: B.Sc.  (Sem -IV) Type:  Theory  
Subject:  DSE -4-Nanoscience  and N anotechnology  
Credit: 02 (T) Total learning hours: 30 
Course description:  Nanoscience is the study of structures and molecules on the scale of 
nanometers and the technology which utilizes it in practical applications is called nanotechnology. 
Today, engineers and researchers are finding a wide variety of methods to deliberately  make 
nanoscale materials to take the advantages of their enhanced properties such as higher strength, 
lighter weight, high chemical reactivity, etc. also the nanotechnology offers more advances in 
disease treatments, in imaging and diagnostics equipment, in energy efficient products such as fuel 
and solar cells, etc. so in order to move towards the advanced materials and devices, students should 
have the knowledge of nanoscience.  
Student learning outcome: After learning the course,students should be able  : 
• To understand the difference between bulk and nanoscale materials.  
• To understand the basics of nanoscale science.  
• To understand the synthesizing technique and difficulties to synthesize the nanomaterials so 
they can get interest in the search of new composition techniques of nanomaterials.  
• To understand the various applications of nanoscience and nanotechnology.
