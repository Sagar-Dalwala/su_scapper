A. About Post Graduate Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology Programme  
 
The Post Graduate Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology  programme offered by 
Sarvajanik University is of one year duration and is consist of two  semesters. The various 
courses of the programme are designed to include classroom teaching  and lectures, laboratory 
work and fi eld trips. Three categories of courses are being offered in this programme: Core 
courses, Skill enhancement courses and Elective course. Students who are trained in this 
programme develop an in -depth exposure into the depths of this field. This post graduat e 
course provides with specialised training in the scientific methods of detecting, treating, 
curing and preventing human diseases and infection through laboratory test. Such technician 
maintains  a position of great significance in health care industry. Th is is practical oriented 
course will allow students to prepare solutions, collect  and examine  samples, analyse results 
and draw conclusion. Students can pursue their career  as technician Academics , R & D 
Laboratories, Multispecialty hospitals, Primary healt h centres, corporate organi zation, & 
Independent practice.
