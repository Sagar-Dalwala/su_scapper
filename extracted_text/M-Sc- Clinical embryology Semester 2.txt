Course
Description: 
The
course
aims
at
catering
the
knowledge
about
basic
Genetics
and
genetic
basis
of
certain 
developmental
defects
and
genetic
disorders.The
course
specifically
covers
the
genetic
correlation 
with
infertility
disorders
in
male
as
well
as
female.
The
other
part
of
the
course
deals
with
the 
importance
and
technicality
of
Preimplantation
Genetic
diagnosis
of
embryo
before
implantation 
into
the
uterus.
It
encompasses
the
application
of
PGD
in
screening
in
case
of
patients
with 
recurrent
IVF
failures
or
recurrent
pregnancy
losses.
It
also
elaborates
on
principles
and
working
of 
the
micromanipulator
which
plays
as
the
heart
of
the
IVF
center .
Student
Learning
Outcome:
After
completion
of
this
course
student
will
be
able
to: 
1.
Correlate
genetic
causes
and
basis
for
infertility
related
genetic
disorders. 
2.
Apply
the
techniques
to
assess
the
embryo
feasibility
and
normalcy
before
implanting
into 
the
patient. 
3.
Learn
about
operating
the
micromanipulator .
