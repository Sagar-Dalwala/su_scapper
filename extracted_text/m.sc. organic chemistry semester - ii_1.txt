Credit: 04(T) + 02 (P)        Total learning hours: 60 
Course description:  This course paper intends to deal about the  Forensic  Toxicology , the branch 
of science that applies the principles and knowledge of toxicology to issues and problems in the 
field of law. To achieve this, techniques of analytical chemistry are combined with principles of 
toxicology to address issues related to the toxic effects of substances on humans that are germane to 
judicial procee dings. Analytical chemistry deals with the techniques and methods for determining 
the identity and relative amounts of unknown components in a sample of matter.   
Student learning outcome:  
 At the end of the course students will be able to  learn ... 
• Forensic chemistry and its scope,  
• Examination of petroleum products, fires, explosives,  
• Types of forensic toxicology, analysis, extraction, isolation and clean up procedures,  
• Forensic examinati on of metallic poison and various organic -toxic compounds.
